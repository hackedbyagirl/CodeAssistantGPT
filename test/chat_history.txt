Summary: Great! I understand that you would like to create a Python project that reads in Excel files and creates a pandas data frame. To ensure that I can assist you effectively, I have a few questions that will help me gather more information about your project. Here is the list of questions:

Questions:
1. Who are the intended users of this program?
2. Are there any specific requirements or functionalities you would like to include in the program?
3. Do you have any preferences for the naming conventions or structure of the pandas data frame?
4. Are there any specific performance criteria your program needs to meet?
5. Are there any security requirements or standards this program needs to adhere to?
6. Do you have a specific name in mind for your Python program?

Please provide your responses in sequence, starting with the first question. If you do not know the answer to a question, please respond with "Skip" and move on to the next question.

1. Who are the intended users of this program?
Based on the project description, system requirements, and architecture, the initial layout of your Python project should be set up as follows:

Directory Structure:
```
- project_name/
    - main.py
    - data/
        - excel_files/
    - utils/
        - excel_reader.py
```

File Descriptions:
1. `main.py`: This file serves as the entry point of your Python program. It will contain the main logic and control flow of your program. Here, you can import and utilize the functions and classes defined in other files to read in Excel files and create pandas data frames.

2. `data/`: This directory is intended to store the Excel files that will be read by your program. You can create subdirectories within this directory to organize your files based on different categories or criteria.

3. `data/excel_files/`: This subdirectory within the `data/` directory specifically holds the Excel files that your program will read. You can place all the relevant Excel files in this directory.

4. `utils/`: This directory is meant to store utility files or modules that contain functions or classes that provide specific functionalities. In this case, you can create a file called `excel_reader.py` within this directory.

5. `utils/excel_reader.py`: This file will contain functions or classes that handle the reading of Excel files and the creation of pandas data frames. You can define functions or classes here that encapsulate the necessary logic to achieve this functionality.

Please note that this is a basic layout to get you started. Depending on the complexity and requirements of your project, you may need to create additional files or directories to organize your code effectively.
main.py
```python
# Import necessary modules
from utils.excel_reader import read_excel_files

def main():
    # Specify the path to the directory containing the Excel files
    excel_files_dir = "data/excel_files"

    # Read the Excel files and create pandas data frames
    data_frames = read_excel_files(excel_files_dir)

    # Perform further operations on the data frames as needed
    # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

utils/excel_reader.py
```python
import pandas as pd
import os

def read_excel_files(directory):
    """
    Read all Excel files in the specified directory and return a list of pandas data frames.

    Args:
        directory (str): Path to the directory containing the Excel files.

    Returns:
        list: A list of pandas data frames, each representing an Excel file.
    """
    data_frames = []
    for filename in os.listdir(directory):
        if filename.endswith(".xlsx") or filename.endswith(".xls"):
            file_path = os.path.join(directory, filename)
            data_frame = pd.read_excel(file_path)
            data_frames.append(data_frame)
    return data_frames
```

Please note that this is a basic implementation to get you started. You may need to modify or extend the code based on your specific requirements and additional functionalities.
test_main.py
```python
import unittest
from unittest.mock import patch
from main import main

class TestMain(unittest.TestCase):
    @patch("utils.excel_reader.read_excel_files")
    def test_main(self, mock_read_excel_files):
        # Mock the return value of read_excel_files
        mock_read_excel_files.return_value = [
            pd.DataFrame({"Column1": [1, 2, 3], "Column2": ["A", "B", "C"]}),
            pd.DataFrame({"Column1": [4, 5, 6], "Column2": ["D", "E", "F"]})
        ]

        # Call the main function
        main()

        # Add assertions to verify the expected behavior
        # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

Please note that this is a basic unit test for the `main` function. You may need to write additional tests to cover other components and functionalities of your codebase.
