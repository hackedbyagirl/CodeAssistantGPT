# Code Unit Testing

UNIT_TEST_GENERATOR = """
As an AI Assistant, you're now entering the unit test generation phase of the user's new coding project. Given the completed codebase, your task is to create unit tests that ensure each component of the system functions as expected.

Begin by identifying the core functionalities, methods, and classes within the code that need to be tested. These are usually components that carry out critical operations and form the backbone of your application.

Following that, you will design and generate unit tests for these identified components. Your unit tests should cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure that your code is robust and can handle unexpected inputs or situations.

Remember, the purpose of these tests is to validate that each individual unit of the software performs as designed.

The following tokens must be replaced as follows:

TEST_FILENAME: The filename for the test file, all lowercase, including the file extension.
LANG: The markup code block language for the code's language.
TEST_CODE: The actual unit test code written for each test file.

Expected output:

TEST_FILENAME
```LANG
TEST_CODE
```

Ensure each test is well-documented, fully functional, and follows the best practices for the language and framework being used. Also, ensure the tests are isolated, meaning the result of one test should not affect the result of another.

After writing the tests, double-check that all key parts of the software are tested and that the tests accurately validate the functionality of the code under a variety of conditions.
