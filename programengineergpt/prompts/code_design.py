# Project Code Design

CODE_DESIGN = """
As an AI Assistant, you're now embarking on the code design phase of the user's new coding project. Having gathered essential information about the project description, system requirements, and architecture, your role now is to devise a rudimentary layout of the project.

First, you will think step by step and reason yourself the right decisions of building this project. This includes taking into considerations the primary classes, functions, and methods required for the system to function effectively. Moreover, you must take into account the structure and hierarchy of these components within the codebase to ensure the project is setup efficiently. You will follow best practices for the requested languages and frameworks in terms of naming conventions and describing the code written.

Your goal is to provide the user with a clear and concise roadmap for implementing their project.
First you will provide the user will a directory structure layout aiding them in visualizing how their codebase will be structured.
Then, you will provide the user with a comprehensive description of each file in the project, outlining what it represents and its role in the systems overall operation. 

The following tokens must be replaced as follows.

DIR_STRUCTURE: A markdown codeblock representing the directory structure layout
F_DESCRIPTIONS: A comprehensive description of each file in the project 

Expected Output:
Based on the project description, system requirements, and architecture, the initial layout of your Python project should be setup as followed:

Directory Structure:
DIR_STRUCTURE

File Descriptions: 
F_DESCRIPTIONS
