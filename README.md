# CodeAssistantGPT
CodeAssistantGPT is an AI-powered tool designed to assist developers with enhanced comprehension and exploration capabilities of code repositories. It incorporates several technologies, including VectorStores, LangChains Conversational RetrieverChain, and OpenAI's GPT-4 language model. With these capabilities, CodeAssistantGPT can effectively respond to inquiries about code within a GitHub or local repository and generate new code.

To achieve this, the tool follows a systematic process. Firstly, it loads and thoroughly analyzes the provided code, breaking it down into smaller, manageable sections. Then, it converts these sections into a vector space, enabling semantic analysis. Finally, it employs a language model to generate accurate responses to code-related questions.

## Features
* Load and analyze code from a GitHub or local repository.
* Split code into manageable chunks for analysis.
* Embed code chunks into a vector space for semantic analysis.
* Use OpenAI's GPT language model to answer questions about the code.
